METHOD OVERLOADING:
 
 Method overloading is the process of different methods having same 
 name but difference in signature (i.e, type of parameters, number 
 of parameters and order of parameters).
 
 * Method overloading promotes virtual polymorphism(false polymorphism).
 * For user it looks like one method is performing multiple tasks but in 
 reality different methods perform different tasks.
