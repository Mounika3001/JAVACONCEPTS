SWITCH CONTROL CONSTRUCT:
========================
 Switch case in Java executes one statement from multiple ones.
 It is similar to the if else ladder, unlike the else if ladder
 which executes every condition linearly, switch condition skips 
 rest of the conditions and directly jumps to the exact condition.
    Simply it switches the execution based on the value present
 in a variable.
