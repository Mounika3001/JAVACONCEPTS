JUMPING CONTROL CONSTRUCTS:
===========================
There are two types of jumping control constructs
1.Break
2.continue

 Break:
 ------
 * Break will bring the control out of the control construct(loop or switch).
 * Any statement which is present under break or continue will get executed.
 
 Continue:
 --------
 Continue in the looping control construct is used to skip the current 
 iteration and moved to next iteration of the loop
