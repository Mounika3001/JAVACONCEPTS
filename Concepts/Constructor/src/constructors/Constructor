CONSTRUCTOR:
===========
Constructors are the specialized methods that has the same name as class name which does not have any return type.
* Constructor would be called at the time of object creation.
* The major use of constructor is to initialize the instance variables at the time of object creation.

Note:
-----
If we do not have any constructor written in the class then by default compiler will add zero parameterized constructor into the class.
Note-2:
-------
Default constructor would be added if and only if programmer have not written any constructor in the class.
* If the programmer has written any constructor then compiler will not add default constructor
