SHADOWING PROBLEM:
=================
  According to industrial standards local variables names should be same in the constructors.
     If local variables and the instance variables are same then local variable values will not reflected in the instance variables. 
 This problem is technically called as "Shadowing Problem".
    Shadowing problem can be resolved by using "this" keyword. "this" keyword holds the address of current object.
